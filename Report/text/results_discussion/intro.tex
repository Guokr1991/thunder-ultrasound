In this chapter, our results obtained using the previously described methods are presented. The methods and their results are also analysed and discussed. The results include not only the quantitative performance, but also the visual quality of the reconstructed volume. The chapter ends with a general discussion of the pixel-based and voxel-based approaches, and of incremental versus non-incremental reconstruction.
%After that, the performance obtained is presented and discussed, and then the reconstruction quality.
%Last, the resource use of the various methods and how they scale with increased problem size is discussed.
