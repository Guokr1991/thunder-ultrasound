Ultrasound is a non-invasive, safe, low cost and practical way to provide medical doctors with an internal view of a patient's body. By performing 3D ultrasound reconstruction, 3D volumes can be constructed from 2D ultrasound scans, and be used for acquiring out-of-angle views, 3D rendering of the anatomy, and for image guided surgery. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the parallel processing power of the GPU for fast ultrasound reconstruction. Having the ability to reconstruct a volume in a fraction of a second enables instant feedback and real-time incremental reconstruction while scanning. This thesis has presented our techniques to perform fast, non-incremental and real-time incremental reconstruction using the GPU. Optimization techniques for both pixel-based and voxel-based approaches have been described, and a novel method of doing real-time incremental reconstruction was presented. The performance obtained by these methods have been measured on some of the latest hardware architectures at the time of writing from both Nvidia and AMD. Issues for future work to look into are suggested in Section \ref{section:future_work}, and some final thoughts and closing statements are also given in Section \ref{section:final_thoughts}.
