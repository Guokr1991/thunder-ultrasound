The purpose of this thesis was to utilize the parallel processing power of the GPU for fast ultrasound reconstruction. We developed techniques that enable reconstruction of an entire volume in only fractions of a second using both pixel-based and voxel-based approaches, and for incremental reconstruction, real-time performance was obtained using our methods. This thesis showed how the parallel nature of ultrasound reconstruction can be exploited, and the techniques developed can benefit anyone who wants to utilize the power of the GPU for reconstruction.
