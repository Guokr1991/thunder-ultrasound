In this chapter, we present our methods for performing fast ultrasound reconstruction using the GPU. Both pixel-based and voxel-based approaches are considered, and the parallelization, implementation and optimization will be described. Here, the input data has been acquired before reconstruction; and so it is not \emph{incremental} at this time. Some tasks are common for both pixel- and voxel-based reconstruction, and these are described first.
%The pixel-based reconstruction is then described followed by the voxel-based reconstruction.
