%Step 1)
%GPU-based real-time 3D ultrasound reconstruction of freehand 2D scans using a tracked ultrasound probe (different algorithms, command-line based).

%Step 2)
%Simultaneous reconstruction and visualization of the ultrasound volume as it gets built. It would be desirable for the surgeon to see a visualization of the volume while the data is acquired and the volume is generated (real-time volume rendering and slicing).

The goals of this thesis are to:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Evaluate how to utilize the GPU in the most efficient manner to speed up computation time of 3D freehand ultrasound reconstruction.
	\item Develop methods to incrementally reconstruct the volume in real-time on the GPU as the data is acquired.
	\item While the data is being reconstructed on the GPU, visualize it in real-time.
\end{itemize}
