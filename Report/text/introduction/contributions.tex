The main contributions of this thesis are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A novel method of doing real-time incremental 3D reconstruction using GPU and CPU.
	\item Optimization techniques for both pixel-based and voxel-based reconstruction on modern GPU architectures.
	\item A software implementation, called \emph{Thunder}, of GPU-based ultrasound reconstruction and visualization including:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Fast reconstruction by voxel-based and pixel-based algorithms.
		\item High-quality reconstruction in real-time as data is acquired incrementally.
		\item Simultaneous reconstruction and visualization by both slices through the volume and ray casting on the GPU.
		\item Multiplatform implementation using the OpenCL standard with performance results on the newest GPU hardware architectures from Nvidia and AMD.
	\end{itemize}
